Let pedestrians run oddly
On the street by the puddles
And there is much of water on asphalt.
They can not understand, that this day is not simple 
And the reason I'm so merry today...
Chorus:
And I'm playing the accordion
And all people gaze at me 
It's a pity, that the Birthday is just once a year...
