Let pedestrians run oddly
On the street by the puddles
And there is much of water on asphalt.
They can not understand, that this day is not simple 
And the reason I'm so merry today...

Chorus:
And I'm playing the accordion
And all people gaze at me 
It's a pity, that the Birthday is just once a year...

The magician soon comes on his blue helicopter He will show us gratuitous film.
He will show us gratuitous film.
He will congratulate me and I'm sure he will
leave to me 500 of chocolate ice-cream...
